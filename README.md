This code basically builds a system to track a driver's level of sleepiness by examining their motions and facial expressions as seen in a video feed. It notices when a driver blinks or yawns, and depending on how often and how long they occur, it interprets this as an indication of fatigue or stress and Alerts!












* **The proposed system consists of the following components:**

1. **ESP32-CAM:** A microcontroller-based development board equipped with a camera module, used to capture the driver's facial expressions.

**Implementation Details:**

The system is implemented in Python, leveraging libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and requests.
Facial landmarks are detected using the FaceMeshDetector module, which provides accurate tracking of key facial features.
Blink detection is achieved by calculating the aspect ratio of the eyes, while yawn detection is based on the distance between mouth landmarks.
Real-time processing of frames is performed in a separate thread to ensure smooth operation without blocking the main thread.
The system provides visual alerts on the video stream interface, indicating the driver's level of alertness based on detected patterns of blinks and yawns.


**Merits of the Model:**
1. **Use of OpenCL :** 
A framework for parallel computing across heterogeneous platforms, such as CPUs, GPUs, and other processing units, is OpenCL (Open Computing Language). The given code makes use of OpenCL to improve the efficiency of some operations, especially OpenCV's image processing duties. The code uses cv2.ocl.setUseOpenCL(True) to activate OpenCL if it can be found on the system and checks for its availability. Faster detection and reaction times can result from more efficient face feature analysis and processing jobs that make use of the computational capability of GPUs or other accelerators via OpenCL.
2. **FaceMesh Model:** 
This facial landmark detection model relies on deep learning. It has been trained to identify important facial features like the mouth, nose, eyebrows, and eyes. The FaceMeshDetector class in the supplied code uses the FaceMesh model to identify facial landmarks in the video stream that the ESP32-CAM recorded. These landmarks are essential for interpreting facial expressions, such as yawns and blinks. The system is able to detect events related to drowsiness by precisely tracking the movement and positions of facial landmarks, which allows it to infer different facial expressions and behaviours.

3. **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR):** 
It is a measurement that is frequently employed in algorithms for blink detection. By comparing the ratio of distances between specific landmarks surrounding the eyes, it measures how open the eyes are. The ratio of the horizontal distance between the left and right inner eye corners to the vertical distance between the top and bottom eyelids is used in the code to determine the EAR. When the EAR significantly decreases, it signifies a blinkâ€”a brief closure of the eyes. Through tracking EAR changes over time, the system is able to precisely identify blinks and deduce the driver's alertness level.

4. **Facial Landmarks :** 
Specific points on the face that correlate to anatomical features like the eyes, nose, mouth, and eyebrows are known as facial landmarks. The FaceMesh model is used in the provided code to detect facial landmarks. It gives a set of coordinates that represent these important points. The system is able to deduce different facial expressions and gestures by examining the positions and movements of facial landmarks over a sequence of frames. For instance, mouth landmarks are used for yawn detection, while the locations of eye landmarks are used to compute the eye aspect ratio for blink detection. Robust facial feature analysis and drowsiness detection depend on the precise identification and tracking of facial landmarks.

5. **Utilising Different Threads for the Model:** 
The tasks of facial feature analysis and processing are carried out in a separate thread from the main programme execution in order to guarantee real-time performance and responsiveness. This method avoids the main thread from being blocked, which could cause frame processing delays and a sluggish user interface. Through the delegation of computationally demanding tasks, like blink/yawn analysis and facial landmark detection, to an independent thread, the system is able to process incoming frames from the video stream without any disruption. The multi-threaded design of the drowsiness detection system improves overall responsiveness and performance while facilitating the efficient use of system resources.








 **The code defines lists of landmark indices that correspond to different aspects of the face. Key points on the face, like the mouth and eyes, are identified and tracked using these lists in combination with the FaceMesh model.**
* **idList:** 
The indices in this list correspond to landmarks that stand in for points surrounding the eyes. These landmarks are essential for tracking eye movements and identifying blinks. The points that the FaceMesh model detected and used to compute the eye aspect ratio and identify blink events are most likely the indices in idList.

* **top_mouth_landmarks and bottom_mouth_landmarks :** 
Include indices that indicate landmarks that define the inner edge of the lips. They serve to delineate the mouth region's upper and lower borders. Through the examination of these landmarks' locations, the system is able to identify oral movements and deduce actions like yawning. The landmarks identified in these arrays probably correspond to particular points that the FaceMesh model identified in the vicinity of the mouth.



**About the plotting of FaceMesh Points:**
* Depending on the particular implementation and model version being used, different numbers of points (landmarks) can be plotted on the face using the FaceMesh model. On the other hand, the FaceMesh model can normally identify and follow a high number of facial landmarks, from about 400 to more than 1,000 points.

* The FaceMesh model is configured in the given code with the maxFaces=1 parameter, meaning that it is intended to identify landmarks on a single face within the frame. The resolution of the input image, the intricacy of the facial expression, and the model's precision are some of the variables that may affect how many points the FaceMesh model precisely detects and tracks.

* The FaceMesh model generally identifies important facial features like the eyes, nose, mouth, eyebrows, and jawline, allowing for thorough facial feature analysis and tracking, even though the precise number of points plotted on the face may vary. This makes it possible to perform tasks like head pose estimation, facial expression recognition, yawn detection, and blink detection, among others.



**Enhancement of Video Processing :**

* **Separate Threading:** 
The system can maintain real-time responsiveness by running video processing operations, such as facial landmark detection and analysis, in a separate thread from the main programme execution. 
To avoid blocking the main thread and guarantee uninterrupted operation, the video processing tasks in the provided code are carried out in a separate thread. 
The drowsiness detection system's overall responsiveness and performance are improved by separate threading, which enables the system to continuously process incoming frames from the video stream without delays. 
Separate threading also makes it possible to execute multiple tasks concurrently, which increases system efficiency. Examples of these tasks include blink and yawn detection.



* **Use of OpenCL:** 
OpenCL makes it possible to leverage the computational power of heterogeneous platforms, such as CPUs, GPUs, and other processing units, by enabling parallel computing across them. 
OpenCL can be used to speed up OpenCV's image processing operations, such as facial landmark detection, which improves detection and response times. 
The code that is provided makes use of OpenCL to improve the efficiency of image processing operations, especially those that are associated with the analysis of facial features. 
By using OpenCL, video frame processing can be accelerated, leading to more effective facial landmark and expression analysis. 
All things considered, using OpenCL for parallel processing speeds up and improves the effectiveness of video processing jobs, which helps the drowsiness detection system function in real time.
